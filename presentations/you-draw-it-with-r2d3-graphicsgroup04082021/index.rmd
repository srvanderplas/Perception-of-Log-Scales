+ **Big Idea:** Determine the effect of stopping iterative maximum likelihood calculations after one iteration.
+ **Method:** Judge by eye the positions for a pair of *parallel* probit regression lines in a biological assay. Sent out by mail, asked to "rule two lines."
+ **Sample:** 21 scientists
+ **Findings:** One cycle of iteration was sufficient.

+ "Where fact and theory are so at variance one guess is as good as another-so here goes. The job might have been easier if S.E. of individual points was known!" (No. 9.) 

+ "I should-say that the points were not on two parallel straight lines, and that was that!" (No. 11.) 
+ "The line through the x points is of course easy to draw. But I had to overcome considerable intellectual resistance before I could bring myself to draw a parallel line for the 0 points". (No. 14.) 

+ "**What fun! But I don't believe a word of it.** The only thing is either (a) to do the experiment again or (b) revise the theory". (No. 18.)

## Eye Fitting Straight Lines (1981)
[(Frederick Mosteller, Andrew F. Siegel, Edward Trapido & Cleo Youtz; *The American Statistician*)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.1981.10479335)

.pull-left[
+ **Big Idea:** Students fitted lines by eye to four sets of points.
+ **Method:** 8.5 x 11 inch transparency with a straight line etched completely across the
middle.
+ **Sample:** 153 graduate students and post docs in Introductory Biostatistics.
+ **Experimental Design:** Latin square with packets stapled in four different orders.
+ **Findings:** Students tended to fit the slope of the first principal component.

+ Method involves maneuvering a string, black thread, or ruler until the fit seems satisfactory, and then drawing the line.
+ Sample - most had not studied statistics before
+ Method proposed by Tukey
+ Students tended to fit the slope of the first principal component or major axis (the line that minimizes the sum of squares of perpendicular rather than vertical distances).
+ Students had a slight tendency to choose consistently either steeper or shallower slopes for all sets of data.
+ Individual-to-individual variability in slope and in intercept was near the standard error provided by least squares for the four data sets (no theory encourages us to believe in such relations).
+ Found no trend in the differences due to order.

To distinguish between code that runs at initialization-time only and code that runs when data changes, organize your code so that the code which responds to data changes is contained within the r2d3.onRender()

An explicit resize handler redraws plot as you resize your browser window
